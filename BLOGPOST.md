# A Quick Guide on How to Import your Excel files using Roo

Have you ever asked yourself how hard it is to import data from Excel files (.xlsx) into a Rails project? Well, taking into account that .xlsx is not plain-text (like csv) but actually a lot of binary, it should be really hard, right?

Actually, no! Thankfully, there are some very smart people out there who love to share their sollutions with us, and the maintainers of [Roo](https://github.com/roo-rb/roo) are one of those people. So today we're gonna learn how to setup and start importing our beloved data from rows in a .xlsx file:

## Creating our spreadsheet and models

Let's picture this: you're a really big farm owner, who owns a lot of *mighty bulls*. You'd like to have them saved as ruby models to check how they are doing, see their information and the offspring count. You'd like to have rows with the following information:

| Registration Code | Name            | Born On    | Offspring Total |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 003               | Freddie The Big | 05/05/2015 | 20              |
| 002               | Arnold II       | 04/04/2014 | 10              |
| 001               | March           | 03/03/2013 | 5               |
| 000               | Zero            | 02/02/2012 | 0               |

Great! Let's save this file with the name bulls.xlsx and create our basic bulls model and migration!
```rb
# migration
class CreateBulls < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :bulls do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.date :born_on
      t.integer :offspring_count
      t.string :registration_code

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

# model
class Bull < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, :born_on, :offspring_count, presence: true
end
```

## Roo Setup

Roo setup is dead simple! You can install it as a gem:

```bash
  $ gem install roo
```

Or add it to your Gemfile

```rb
  gem "roo", "~> 2.10.0"
```

If you'd like more information on setup, you can find in the official [README](https://github.com/roo-rb/roo#readme)

## Importing our data

We can start with simply initializing you spreadsheet model using its relative path and Roo::Excelx.new:

```rb
  spreadsheet = Roo::Excelx.new("./bulls.xlsx")
```
We can check some basic info about the spreadsheet using:

```rb
  spreadsheet.info

  # => File: bulls.xlsx
  # Number of sheets: 1
  # Sheets: PÃ¡gina1
  # First row: 1
  # Last row: 5
  # First column: A 
  # Last column: D
```

*Roo* provide us with multiple ways to interact with our imported data, the best one is up to you, it can depend on your business logic, data format and so on, we'll present some ways, but check out the [official docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/roo) to know what fits better for you

We can access some important information about our spreadsheet object, some of this information has already been given to us with the '.info()' method, but it is useful to access this values directly, e.g:
```rb
spreadsheet.first_row
# => 1

spreadsheet.last_row
# => 5

spreadsheet.first_column
# => 1

spreadsheet.last_column
# => 5
```

We can access each row as an array, iterating the spreadsheet with '.each' we have:
```rb
  # This access wil also access the headers!
  spreadsheet.each do |row|
    puts row.inspect
  end

  # ["Registration Code", "Name", "Born On", "Offspring Count"]
  # ["003", "Freddie The Biggie", Tue, 05 May 2015, 20]
  # ["002", "Arnold II", Fri, 04 Apr 2014, 10]
  # ["001", "March", Sun, 03 Mar 2013, 5]
  # ["000", "Zero", Thu, 02 Feb 2012, 0]
```

If we know where the information we want is, we can access it directly using .cell(row, column)

```rb
desired_row = 2
desired_column = 3

spreadsheet.cell(desired_row, desired_column)
# => Fri, 15 May 2015
```

Or maybe you'd like to import it as a hash?

```rb
  bull_attributes_headers = {
    registration_code: 'Registration Code',
    name: 'Name',
    born_on: 'Born On',
    offspring_count: 'Offspring Count'
  }

  # This will check for the correct headers values
  spreadsheet.each(bull_attributes_headers) do |row|
    puts row.inspect
  end

  # {:registration_code=>"Registration Code", :name=>"Name", :born_on=>"Born On", :offspring_count=>"Offspring Count"}
  # {:registration_code=>"003", :name=>"Freddie The Biggie", :born_on=>Tue, 05 May 2015, :offspring_count=>20 }
  # {:registration_code=>"002", :name=>"Arnold II", :born_on=>Fri, 04 Apr 2014, :offspring_count=>10}
  # {:registration_code=>"001", :name=>"March", :born_on=>Sun, 03 Mar 2013, :offspring_count=>5}
  # {:registration_code=>"000", :name=>"Zero", :born_on=>Thu, 02 Feb 2012, :offspring_count=>0}
```
## Tests, Tests, Tests
So.. how do we test it?

We don't.

Really, we don't want to test the gem per say, this is a job for the maintaners of the Roo gem, we will test if *our* importation is working as intended, if the values are on the desired format, if we are correctly accessing the row and column we want.

A good practice would be to create service objects with the importation and testing it (that's what we've done!) but just like all things on life, it also *depends*, see what's the best fit for your project!

## Difference between '.cell ()' and '.formatted_value()'
Now this is some important stuff, both of these methods return us values that are presente in the spreadsheet, right? Kinda.

If you've haven't noticed yet, rails magic has been happening since the start of this blogpost, the format of the imported data is correct and is exactly what we expected, but.. how? Well, this happens because there is a 'format' value assigned to each and every cell we've been using, we can check this format closely using:
```rb
# For excelx spreadsheets we can use:
spreadsheet.excelx_type(2, 3)
# => [:numeric_or_formula, "dd/mm/yyyy"]

# or for any type of spreadsheet we can also use:
spreadsheet.celltype(2, 3)
# => :date
```
There we have it, the cell object has a *type*, that's how Roo has been doing its magic, this type is defined by the file itself, its the data type/format defined by the user, be it a date, a number or a string.

Ok, cool, but what about the .formatted_value()? Well, think of it as [...]
